# Code Quiz

##
A timed quiz with multiple choice coding questions.

## Description
A short, multiple-choice quiz featuring JavaScript questions.

## Usage
Once the start button is pressed, a timer will begin and multiple choice questions will appear on the screen. Select your answer and the questions will cycle through one by one. Once the quiz is finished (assuming your score isn't 0), you will be shown your score and given the option to enter your initials. When the High Score button is pressed, it will display a list of all high scores (if any exist).
